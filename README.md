# Anki_template

Welcome to the Anki_template repository! This collaborative project is dedicated to enhancing Anki deck templates, providing both guidelines for contributors and access to downloadable decks via AnkiWeb. Our goal is to create a resourceful hub for users looking to improve their Anki experience with well-designed, efficient, and effective flashcard decks.

## Project Overview

The Anki_template repository is structured to facilitate easy access and contribution:

- **/templates**: Contains the custom template files that can be imported into Anki.
- **/guidelines**: Includes documentation on how to effectively create and modify Anki deck templates.
- **/examples**: Sample decks that demonstrate the capabilities and design patterns of our templates.
- **/scripts**: Optional scripts to automate or enhance the templates or decks.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you can use these templates, you need to have Anki installed on your computer. Anki is a free and open-source flashcard program that uses spaced repetition, a technique from cognitive science for fast and long-lasting memorization. You can download Anki from [AnkiWeb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

### Installing Templates

To use a template from this repository in your Anki decks:

1. Clone this repository or download the desired template:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Anki_template.git
   ```
2. Open Anki and select the deck you want to apply the template to, or create a new one.
3. Go to `Tools` > `Manage Note Types`.
4. Click on `Add` to create a new type or `Options` to modify an existing type.
5. In the `Cards` section, you can copy and paste the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the template files into the appropriate fields.

## Usage Examples

After installing a template, you might want to customize it to better fit your learning style or the specific content you are studying. Here’s a basic example of how you can modify a template:

1. **Open the Card Template Editor**: As mentioned above, navigate through `Tools` > `Manage Note Types`, then select a note type and click `Cards`.
2. **Customize HTML**: Modify the HTML to change how information is displayed. For instance, add a new field by inserting `{{FieldName}}` where you want it to appear on the card.
3. **Adjust Styling**: Change the CSS to alter colors, fonts, and spacing to make viewing more comfortable or to emphasize certain parts of the content.
4. **Enhance with JavaScript**: Use JavaScript to add interactive elements or complex behaviors to your cards.
